// Trust is a gate, not a log. It is the enforcement point of the policy
// envelope named by the RecoveryRequest. It consumes the request's policy
// profile and the attested compute peer — the party whose TEE Evidence the
// vault verified on the Return Path handshake and that would receive the
// disclosures — consults the operator's stop list (ADR 0010), and produces
// a signed AttestationResult. The vault daemon records TRUST_EVALUATED for
// every decision before acting on it (ADR 0015).
