// out-of-process compute-side verifier) can be slotted in without
// rewriting the aggregation rule.
//
// Aggregation rule:
//
//	operational fail  → overall fail
//	operational miss  → overall fail   (operational is mandatory on receive side)
//	operational pass  + any other-dim fail → overall fail
//	operational pass  + every other-dim pass → overall pass
//	operational pass  + any other-dim conditional_fail → overall conditional_fail
//
// The mandatory-operational rule mirrors the release-side §5
// aggregation rule exactly — operational is the veto dimension on
// both sides.
//
// VerdictConditionalFail from the operational dimension is mapped
// defensively to VerdictFail because the operational dimension is
// binary by contract; a producer that nevertheless emits
// ConditionalFail is treated as having failed rather than silently
// promoted to a looser category.
