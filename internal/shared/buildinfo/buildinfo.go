// Package buildinfo answers "which build is this?" for a binary that was not
// built by this repository's Makefile.
//
// The Makefile stamps -X main.version / -X main.commit, so `make build` and the
// release workflow produce binaries that know what they are. One path a reader
// is explicitly invited to take does not go through the Makefile:
//
//	go install github.com/vault-genome/vaultgenome-core/cmd/acpctl@v0.3.2
//
// That printed "acpctl 0.0.0-dev (commit none)", an unhelpful answer from a
// project whose claim is that you can tell what you are running. Go records the
// module version and the VCS revision in the binary itself, so when the ldflags
// are absent we read those instead.
//
// The image built from this repository's Dockerfile is a third case: its build
// context excludes .git, so Go can embed no revision there. That one is solved
// in the Dockerfile, by passing VERSION and COMMIT as build arguments.
