// RecipientAAD is the associated-data struct bound into every
// DisclosureMessage's AES-256-GCM seal. Its canonical-JSON bytes are the
// AAD argument to Seal on the release side and to Open on the receive
// side.
//
// Why it lives in the contract package, not in /vault/disclosure/
//
// Doctrine invariant #1 ("Vault is authority") forbids non-vault
// packages from importing release-side authority code. The receive-side
// reassembler must, however, be able to reconstruct the exact bytes
// that were fed to the sealer — so either the receiver has to reach
// into /vault/disclosure/ (forbidden), or the AAD shape must live
// somewhere both sides can import.
//
// The DisclosureMessage envelope is already the cross-boundary
// contract. Extracting the AAD struct into the same package expresses
// the doctrinal truth: the AAD shape is a wire-protocol fact, not a
// release-authority decision.
//
// # Wire stability
//
// The field set and JSON names are FIXED. Any change is a breaking
// doctrinal bump — every sealed DisclosureMessage ever issued would
// fail Open otherwise. This struct does NOT carry a SchemaVersion
// because every byte of the envelope that feeds it also cross-binds
// via the authority signature; a sealer-only adversary cannot break
// this without also breaking Ed25519.
