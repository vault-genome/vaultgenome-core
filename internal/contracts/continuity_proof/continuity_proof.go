	Subject ids.GenomeID `json:"subject"`

	// AncestorChain is the full, signed descent record, in pre-order
	// DFS from Subject toward roots. Index 0 is Subject's own AGD; at
	// least one element must be a generation-0 genesis (Generation=0
	// and Provenance.DerivedFrom empty). Every non-root AGD's
	// DerivedFrom parent MUST appear elsewhere in the chain — there
	// are no dangling parent references. Merge-parented DAGs are
	// expressed by listing a shared ancestor once; multiple children
	// cite it by GenomeID.

	// BatteryMerkleRoot MUST equal ProbeScorecard.BatteryMerkleRoot,

	// IssuedAt is the wall-clock moment the issuer bound this bundle.

	// SigningKeyID identifies the authority that signed this bundle.

	// ASSERTION "I, the issuing authority, vouch that this bundle is
	// internally consistent and that I stand behind its release."
