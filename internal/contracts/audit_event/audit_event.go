// Package audit_event defines the AuditEvent canonical contract —
// the structured, binder-attached evidence record of an authority decision.
//
// # Doctrinal role
//
// Audit is first-class, not a log line. Every authority decision emits
// AuditEvent records BEFORE the decision becomes visible to its callers.
// VALIDATION_FINDING events in particular must be written before a fail or
// conditional_fail ValidationResult is returned — un-evidenced decisions
// are not governed decisions (docs/doctrine/validation-thresholds.md §9).
//
// AuditEvent records form a hash-chained append-only log. The chain is
// implemented in /internal/audit/chain; this contract is the record shape.
//
// Canonical term: "Audit Event" — docs/doctrine/terminology.md §2, §3.

// Kind enumerates the event types. The list is frozen at any given

//
// Kinds are partitioned into three families:
//
//   - Release-side (v1, stages 1–8 + incident arcs): the Vault's
//     terminal-authority audit slots — REQUEST_RECEIVED through
//     INCIDENT_TERMINATED.
//   - Receive-side envelope/decision (v2, Stage F): the recipient
//     environment's bootstrap-and-reconstitution audit slots —
//     DISCLOSURE_RECEIVED and RECONSTITUTION_DECIDED. See
//     docs/doctrine/bootstrap-contracts.md.
//   - Receive-side validator (v3, Stage G): the receive-side
//     operational-only validator's audit slots — RECV_VALIDATION_STARTED
//     and RECV_VALIDATION_COMPLETED. These are distinct from the
//     release-side VALIDATION_* kinds because an observer cross-checking
//     the two sides' ledgers must be able to tell release verdicts and
//     receive verdicts apart at the Kind level.
//   - The three families share the AuditEvent envelope contract but are
//     written into separate hash-chained logs (release-side chain vs
//     receive-side chain). The shared envelope keeps the schema small
//     and the cross-side cross-checks straightforward.

	// kinds in strict order:
	//
	//   1. KindCrossCloudHandshakeInitiated — appended BEFORE the
	//      handshake request is dispatched to the destination. Pins
	//      DecisionID, DestinationTEEKind, DestinationEndpoint, and the
	//      handshake nonce into the audit chain so an observer can
	//      verify the cross-cloud flow began without seeing the
	//      destination's response.
	//
	//   2. KindCrossCloudAttestationVerified — appended AFTER local
	//      verification of the destination's Evidence (via the
	//      tee.Registry-resolved verifier) and BEFORE the
	//      KeyReleasePolicy is consulted. Pins the verified
	//      DestinationMeasurement so cross-ledger observers can
	//      confirm the policy decision was made against the same
	//      measurement that was attested.
	//
	//   3. KindKeyReleaseAuthorized — appended AFTER policy approval
	//      and BEFORE the KeyReleaseToken is dispatched. Pins the
	//      destination measurement, the set of KeyIDs released, and
	//      the policy version applied. This is the audit-first-class
	//      slot for the new authority decision introduced by Phase 4
	//      (key release across vendor TEEs).
	//
	//   4. KindCrossCloudRestoreCompleted — appended AFTER the
	//      destination signals successful restore via out-of-band
	//      confirmation. Pins the byte hash of the restored genome
	//      and the destination's local validation outcome.
	//
	// All four kinds are release-side; the receive-side chain records
	// its existing KindDisclosureReceived / KindRecvValidationStarted /
	// KindRecvValidationCompleted / KindReconstitutionDecided as today
	// — the cross-cloud handshake adds NO new receive-side kinds
	// because the receive-side decision points are unchanged (DEKs are
