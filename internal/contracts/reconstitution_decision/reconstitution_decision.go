//	(Vault authorises release)       (recipient asserts successful reassembly)
//
// A ReleaseDecision says: "I, the Vault, authorise that the Genome
// described by this manifest may be released under this session, on the
// basis of this ValidationResult." A ReconstitutionDecision says: "I,
// the receiving environment, assert that what I received reassembled
// into the same Genome the Vault authorised, as evidenced by this
// receive-side ValidationResultID and this receive-side
// AuditEventID."
//
// The two decisions are made by different authorities, signed by
// different keys, and audited in different chains. The receive-side
// validation threshold (receive-side invariant #5 mirror) and the
// receive-side audit binding (receive-side invariant #8 mirror) are
// structurally required here:
//
//	ValidationResultID MUST be present — an unvalidated reconstitution
//	  is not admissible, just as an unvalidated release is not.
//	AuditEventID MUST be present — an un-evidenced reconstitution is
//	  not admissible, just as an un-evidenced release is not.
//
// The Reason enum is closed; extending it is a schema bump. Unlike
// ReleaseDecision, the receive-side failure modes include cases that
// cannot arise on the release side (for example "reassembly_failed" —
// the receive-side got the disclosures but the ordered concatenation
// did not produce a well-formed Genome).
//
// Corresponds to P1 §[0051]–[0052] (self-bootstrapping) and P3 §[0042].
