// Package bootstrap_manifest defines the BootstrapManifest canonical
// contract — the receive-side recipe for assembling an AI Genome from a
// sequence of authorized disclosures.
//
// # Doctrinal role
//
// Staged Disclosure is enforced at the Vault: the release-side
// ReconstructionJobManifest names which components will be emitted, and
// each DisclosureMessage carries one component. The receive-side needs
// its own artifact that states, before any bytes arrive: "in this
// session, under this policy version, I expect exactly these component
// disclosures, in this order, and I will refuse any disclosure outside
// that list."
//
// That artifact is BootstrapManifest. It is the RECEIVE-SIDE MIRROR of
// ReconstructionJobManifest:
//
//	Vault side                       Receive side
//	────────────────────────────     ────────────────────────────
//	ReconstructionJobManifest    →   BootstrapManifest
//	   (what the Vault authorizes)      (what the recipient will accept)
//
// The two shapes are deliberately separate. If they were the same type,
// silent drift between "authorized" and "accepted" could not be named by
// the type system. Keeping them distinct makes identity mismatch an
// explicit doctrine-level claim that can be asserted cross-contract.
//
// A BootstrapManifest is signed by the receiving environment's signing
// authority (separate key, separate purpose) and bound to a specific
// SessionID and ManifestID. It carries no keys, no payloads, and no
// Genome material — only the ordered list of ExpectedDisclosureIDs and
// the shape assertions required to accept the stream.
//
// Corresponds to P1 §[0051]–[0052] (self-bootstrapping receive-side
// orchestration) and P3 §[0042].
