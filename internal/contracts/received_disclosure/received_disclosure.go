// Package received_disclosure defines the ReceivedDisclosure canonical
// contract — the receive-side record of a single DisclosureMessage that
// was accepted by the bootstrap orchestrator.
//
// # Doctrinal role
//
// A ReceivedDisclosure is NOT a copy of a DisclosureMessage. It is the
// ASSERTION by the receive-side: "I received one wire payload whose
// SHA-256 is H, I treated it as the Nth disclosure in this bootstrap
// under this session, and I accepted it at time T."
//
// Keeping this as a distinct type (rather than re-serialising the
// release-side DisclosureMessage) makes a specific class of bug
// impossible to hide: if the bytes the receive-side accepted differ
// from the bytes the Vault emitted, the wire-hash recorded here will
// not match the canonical-bytes hash computed on the release side.
// Operational validation sub-check op.manifest_integrity (see
// docs/doctrine/validation-thresholds.md §4.2) has its receive-side mirror
// here: the bootstrap orchestrator MUST be able to prove, from these
// records alone, that every accepted payload hashes to what the Vault
// signed.
//
// Release side                     Receive side
// ──────────────────────────       ────────────────────────────
// DisclosureMessage            →   ReceivedDisclosure
//
//	(what the Vault signed)          (what the recipient recorded)
//
// ReceivedDisclosure records NO sealed payload, NO nonce, NO recipient
// key. Those belong on the release-side DisclosureMessage, which is
// already signed. The receive-side needs only the hashes and the
// provenance binding.
//
// Corresponds to P1 §[0052] and P3 §[0042].
