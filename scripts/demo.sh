# demo.sh — narrated end-to-end walkthrough of the AI Continuity Platform
# vertical slice AND receive-side round trip. Drives the in-repo integration
# tests as a guided flow, with one-line commentary per stage so an observer
# on a pilot call can follow along in plain English.
#
# This is not a production tool. It is a teaching harness. It exercises the
# doctrine-frozen invariants described in 00_Stage_A_Summary.md §2 and the
# two-tier integrity split pinned down in 00_Bootstrap_Contracts_Doctrine.md
# §8.4 against the in-repo implementation.
#
# The demo is a two-act walkthrough:
#
#   Act I  — Release-side slice (Stages 1–9 of the release flow):
#            Intake → Trust Admission → Session → Staged Disclosure →
#            Delegated Compute → Return Path → Validation → Release Decision.
#            Carries invariants #2, #3, #4, #5, #8.
#            Test target: TestVerticalSlice_*
#
#   Act II — Receive-side round trip (Stages R.1–R.6 of the bootstrap flow):
#            BootstrapManifest → Orchestrator.Start → Accept (tier 1 wire-hash) →
#            Reassembler.Admit (tier 2 plaintext hash/size) → Finalize
#            (Merkle + GenomeID round-trip) → Decide (signed ReconstitutionDecision).
#            Carries the two-tier integrity split (§8.4), invariants #1, #5-mirror,
#            #8-mirror, and R-14 content-addressing on the receive side.
#            Test target: TestRoundtripSlice_*
#
# Usage:
#   make demo               # from core/
#   bash scripts/demo.sh    # from core/
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — both acts passed; all 15 narrated stages exercised.
#   non-zero — at least one act failed; the demo surfaces the go test output.
