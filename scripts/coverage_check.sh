# coverage_check.sh — enforces the coverage policy in
# docs/doctrine/ci-security-policy.md §8.
#
# What is measured: statement coverage of every product package
# (internal/, cmd/, pkg/), read from a cross-package profile
# (`go test -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`, which is
# what `make coverage` produces). A statement counts as covered when any
# test in the module executes it; each statement is counted once, however
# many test binaries report it. Packages are weighted by statements, not
# by function.
#
# What is required: every product package reaches its class target —
#
#   internal/contracts/...               80%
#   internal/validation/operational/...  90%
#   internal/vault/orchestration/...     85%
#   everything else                      70%
#
# — unless scripts/coverage_floors.txt lists it with a lower floor.
# That file is a ratchet for packages still below target: a listed
# package may not drop below its floor, floors are only ever raised,
# and a package leaves the file once it meets its target. The product
# total may not drop below the file's `total` floor either. A new
# package cannot be added below target without a reviewed floors entry.
#
# Usage: scripts/coverage_check.sh [profile]   (default: coverage.out)
