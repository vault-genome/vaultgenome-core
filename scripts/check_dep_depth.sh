# check_dep_depth.sh — fails if the transitive dependency graph exceeds the
# depth cap set by 00_CI_Security_Policy.md §3.2.
#
# Doctrinal role
#
#   Every transitive hop multiplies the supply-chain blast radius. Policy §3.2
#   therefore fixes a hard cap of three: no direct dependency may pull in a
#   chain longer than 3 edges (direct = depth 1, its dep = depth 2, etc.).
#   Exceptions are permissible only when documented in
#   docs/dependencies/exceptions.md with both founders' sign-off.
#
# Algorithm
#
#   1. Determine the main module path via `go list -m`.
#   2. Enumerate edges with `go mod graph`. Each line is
#          <parent@version>   <child@version>
#      except lines whose first field is the main module, which has no
#      @version suffix.
#   3. BFS from the main module. Depth of main = 0. Depth of a direct
#      dependency = 1. Fail if any reachable node has depth > MAX_DEPTH.
#   4. Explicitly allow entries listed in scripts/dep_depth_exceptions.txt
#      (one module-path prefix per line, `#` comments ignored). This mirrors
#      the exceptions mechanism in 00_CI_Security_Policy.md §3.2 without
#      requiring the script to parse the prose markdown.
#
# The script does not modify files and is safe to run locally.
