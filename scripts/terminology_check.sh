#
# Scope of the gate: it enforces that the rename away from the project's
# former names (NSV / NeuralSeedVault / neural_seed_vault / genome_vault)
# is complete — those tokens must not reappear in source or docs. The
# vocabulary preferences in terminology.md §5 (e.g. "rewind"/"regenerate"
# over "restore") are ADVISORY house style, not a build gate; see §5 for
# why they are documented rather than enforced.

# Deprecated project-name tokens, frozen by docs/doctrine/terminology.md §4.
# These enforce that the rename to "VaultGenome" / "genome" is complete: the
# former names must not reappear in source or docs. Matched as whole tokens
# (so SessionFooNSV would not trip NSV) and case-sensitively.
#
# The vocabulary preferences of terminology.md §5 are deliberately NOT listed
# here. They are advisory house style, not a gate: the codebase uses words
# like "restore" and "backup" in their ordinary English sense (e.g. "restore
# a sealed genome to a target directory"), and gating them would fail on
# hundreds of correct, readable usages without improving the product.
