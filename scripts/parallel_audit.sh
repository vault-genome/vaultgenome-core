# parallel_audit.sh — reports the fraction of top-level Test* functions
# that call t.Parallel(). Enforces the doctrinal floor (≥80%) recorded
# in 00_Bootstrap_Contracts_Doctrine.md §13 (Stage G Iteration 4).
#
# Rationale
#
# The Go race detector only trips when goroutines actually overlap on
# shared memory. A codebase that declares t.Parallel() on 80%+ of its
# tests exposes concurrency bugs under `go test -race ./...` that would
# otherwise sleep for years. This script keeps that coverage from
# regressing.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — OK (coverage ≥ PARALLEL_AUDIT_FLOOR, default 80).
#   1 — coverage below the floor.
#   2 — invocation / environment error.
#
# Usage: run from the repo root. No arguments.

# Count every top-level Test function. We restrict the match to
# 'func TestXxx(t *testing.T)' — benchmarks, helpers, and example
# functions are deliberately excluded from the denominator because
# t.Parallel() is only meaningful on test functions.
#
# Tight regex so `TestingFoo` helpers and `funcTest*` typos don't
# contribute false positives to the denominator.

# Count tests that actually declare t.Parallel() anywhere in their body.
# The heuristic scans every Test* function's opening line and the line
# immediately following; we consider the test "parallel-enabled" if the
# first non-blank line of its body is `t.Parallel()`. This matches the
# idiomatic placement and is what the sweep script in
# scripts/parallel_audit.sh (self) produced.
#
# Implementation note: awk is simpler than a multi-pass grep pipeline
# for the "next non-blank line after a matching header" pattern.
