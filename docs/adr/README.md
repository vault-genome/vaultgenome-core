# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory holds the ADRs that capture every significant
architectural decision in the Vault Genome codebase. Each ADR is a
self-contained Markdown file numbered sequentially.

The format is loosely based on
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) but adapted for our doctrine
norms — see [ADR-0004](0004-doctrine-invariants-as-tests.md) for how
ADRs interact with the test-enforced invariant system.

## Adding an ADR

1. Pick the next number. Numbers are sequential and never reused — if
   an ADR is later superseded, the new ADR cites the old one in its
   header.
2. Copy `0001-…md`'s structure: status table, Context, Decision,
   Consequences, Alternatives considered, optional implementation
   checklist or future directions.
3. Add an entry to the index table above.
4. If the ADR introduces or amends a doctrinal invariant, pair it
   with a `TestInvariant_NN_…` in `test/doctrine/`
   (see [ADR-0004](0004-doctrine-invariants-as-tests.md)).
5. Submit as a separate PR ahead of the implementation change so
   the ADR can be reviewed against intent, not against working code.

## Status values

- **Proposed** — drafted, under review.
- **Accepted** — merged; constraint is in force.
- **Deprecated** — no longer the preferred approach but not yet replaced.
- **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** — replaced by a newer decision; both
  ADRs remain in the repo for historical context.

ADRs are NEVER deleted. Even superseded ADRs document why a path was
abandoned, which is often the most useful information for the next
engineer who considers re-treading it.
