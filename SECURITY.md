# Security policy

Vault Genome takes the security of its codebase, releases, and
deployments seriously. This document explains how to report a
vulnerability and what to expect from us.

## Threat model (short form)

The AI Continuity Platform is defensive infrastructure designed to
operate in environments where:

- Physical data centres may be destroyed.
- Network paths may be actively disrupted or observed.
- Some operator accounts, build runners, or dependencies may be compromised.
- An adversary may attempt to coerce disclosure of the AI Genome
  through technical, social, or legal means.

The security posture is governance-first: the **Vault** is the sole
authority on every continuity-relevant decision; sessions are
mandatory; disclosure is always staged; validation must precede any
release. A compromise that weakens any of those invariants is, by
our own definition, critical.

See `docs/internal/stage-a-summary.md` §2 (private repo) and the public
[`docs/security/threat_model.md`](docs/security/threat_model.md) for
the enumerated doctrinal invariants that security review must protect.

## Supported versions

We accept security reports against:

- The `main` branch of this repository.
- Every released version listed at
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vault-genome/vaultgenome-core/releases).

Out of supported scope:

- Forks we don't maintain.
- Build environments that bypass the reproducible-build flow
  documented in [`docs/security/supply_chain.md`](docs/security/supply_chain.md).
- Customer-side deployments where the customer has modified our code
  (escalate via the customer's security team first; if the issue
  reproduces against our published binaries, escalate to us per the
  reporting process below).

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security reports.**
Public disclosure before a patch is available exposes every running
deployment to the very attack we're trying to prevent.

Use one of the following private channels in order of preference:

1. **GitHub private security advisory** — preferred.
   Visit https://github.com/vault-genome/vaultgenome-core/security/advisories/new
   and create a draft advisory. This is the most secure channel; only
   the project maintainers see the report.

2. **Email** — `security@vaultgenome.com`. Encrypt with our PGP key
   (fingerprint listed below); plain-text email is acceptable but
   the GitHub channel above is preferred. The key file lives at
   `docs/security/pgp_key.asc` once first generated.

3. **Signal** — operationally for time-sensitive issues only;
   request the number through the email channel first.

### What to include

The most useful reports answer:

- **What is the vulnerability?** (a sentence or two)
- **Which component is affected?** (file path, function name, or
  CVE-style identifier such as "AWS Nitro adapter signature
  verification")
- **Affected commit SHA or release tag.**
- **How does an attacker exploit it?** (proof-of-concept input,
  attacker capabilities, prerequisites)
- **What is the impact?** (read access? write access? privilege
  escalation? denial of service? bypass of which doctrinal
  invariant?)
- **Suggested mitigation, if you have one** (optional)
- **Your preferred disclosure timeline** (optional)

A reproducer that runs against `make test` is gold; we'll work back
from a vague description but it slows us down.

## What to expect

We commit to:

- **Acknowledgement** within **72 hours**.
- **First triage assessment** within **7 days** — whether we accept
  the report, whether it's a duplicate, whether it falls within our
  supported scope.
- **Remediation target** based on severity:
  - **CRITICAL** (breaks a doctrinal invariant): **14 days**
  - **HIGH** (breaks a guarantee within a doctrinal invariant):
    **30 days**
  - **MEDIUM**: scheduled into the next release window
  - **LOW**: best-effort
- **Credit** for the discoverer in the published advisory unless
  they request otherwise.
- **Coordinated public disclosure** — 90-day window by default;
  earlier acceptable if the vulnerability is already being actively
  exploited and silence would harm users more than disclosure.

### What you should NOT expect

- **Bug bounty payments.** We do not currently run a paid bounty
  programme. Our gratitude is genuine but unmonetised.
- **Same-day patches** except for CRITICAL severity issues with
  active exploitation.
- **Coverage of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.** Those
  go through the upstream maintainer's process; our SBOM (`make sbom`)
  lists every dependency so you can find the right upstream. We
  track upstream security advisories via `govulncheck` + `osv-scanner`
  on every CI run.

## Severity classification

We use the [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)
calculator with the following project-specific guidance:

| Severity  | Examples                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CRITICAL  | RCE in `sagvd` exposed via the public HTTP API; bypass of TEE attestation; key extraction from `internal/vault/keys`; audit-chain forgery undetected by `acpctl audit verify` |
| HIGH      | DoS that crashes `sagvd` from a single attacker request; bypass of one or more validation gates; unauthorised cross-tenant key access; release decision short-circuit |
| MEDIUM    | Information disclosure via timing side-channels; bypass of one validation stage but caught by another; rate-limit bypass; predictable secret leakage in logs |
| LOW       | Hardening missed (e.g. weak default config); operational hygiene gaps; missing depth-of-defence checks |

A doctrinal-invariant violation always rounds UP one severity level;
e.g., a "MEDIUM by CVSS but breaks Invariant 7" is treated as HIGH.

## Scope

### In scope

- All Go code in this repository: the daemons (`sagvd`, `acp-compute`,
  `acp-bootstrap`), the CLIs (`acpctl`, `acp-demo`), the `internal/`
  packages and the public `pkg/teeconformance` package.
- Container images built from `Dockerfile` and `deploy/compose/`.
- The CI workflows under `.github/workflows/` (a vulnerability there
  could compromise the supply chain — treat as CRITICAL).
- Cosign signing flow + SLSA provenance generation.
- The evidence-capture tooling under `scripts/hardware-test/` (not
  shipped, but it provisions cloud resources and handles attestation
  material).

### Out of scope

- The simulated TEE backend (`internal/shared/tee/simulated.go`) is
  explicitly NOT a real TEE; reports of "the simulated TEE doesn't
  resist hardware attacks" will be politely declined. Production
  deployments must use a real-hardware backend.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we integrate with (AWS,
  Microsoft, Google, Intel, AMD, sigstore Rekor). Report those to
  the respective vendor.
- Issues that require physical access to the host running Vault
  Genome (deployment / facility concern, not a code defect).
- Theoretical cryptographic weaknesses in the underlying primitives
  (Ed25519, AES-256-GCM, SHA-256). We follow the NIST consensus on
  these; if NIST deprecates a primitive, our migration plan is in
  the relevant ADR.
- Vulnerabilities in Go itself or its standard library (we track
  these via `govulncheck` and patch on the next release).
- Denial-of-service caused by legitimate heavy load in non-production
  environments.
- Social-engineering attacks against individual contributors (please
  still tell us so we can warn the team, but treat as informational
  rather than a CVE).

## PGP key

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

[Public key to be generated and published at
docs/security/pgp_key.asc on first public release. Until then,
please use the GitHub private security advisory channel — it
provides equivalent confidentiality.]

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Fingerprint: `[to be filled in once the key is generated]`

## Supply-chain assurance

Every released binary is signed with `cosign` against a Sigstore
public transparency log. Every release ships an SBOM generated by
`syft`. SLSA Level 2 today; Level 3 tracked by the
`make verify-reproducible` CI sub-check. See
[`docs/security/supply_chain.md`](docs/security/supply_chain.md) for
the full attestation stack and exact verification commands a buyer
or auditor can run.

If you observe an unsigned or mis-signed release artefact, treat it
as a CRITICAL incident and report it per the instructions above.

## Hall of thanks

(Empty as of 2026-05-06. We add discoverers here on coordinated
disclosure unless they request otherwise.)
