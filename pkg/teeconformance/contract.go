// 32 bytes (SHA-256), 48 bytes (SHA-384, as SEV-SNP and Nitro report)
// or 64 bytes (SHA-512). Conformance does not constrain how the value
// is computed — only that its length is one ValidMeasurementLen accepts
// and that the verifier returns exactly the bytes the producer declares.
// Truncating a measurement to fit a narrower type is non-conformant: it
// would let two different workloads share an identity (ADR 0007).
